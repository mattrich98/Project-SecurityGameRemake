Security Game Remake
<hr>
<h4>"The Odin Project" is mostly read without application currently, so I need to put into practice what you have learned.</h4>
Previous I've followed the tutorial for the previous Security Game project, so I'd like to try the following:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>To complete this project with my current knowledge + some research. 
<br>
<li>To further practice JavaScript
<br>
<ul>
<li>if, loops, boolean values, string literals, etc. 
</ul>
</ul>
