<strong><u>Plans/Todos:</u></strong>

<li>To understand what I am doing.

<strong><u>plans:</u></strong>
<ol>
<li><s> Game timer loop on ticks when play button starts</s></li>
<li><s>Add timer that links with timer loop</s></li>
<br>
<li><s>use math.random api to make enemy and person move random spaces on board</s></li>
<li><s>onclick enemy -1 point, onclick person +1 point</s></li>
<li><s>point system with alert at end saying score.</s></li>
<br>
<li><s>able to restart game from play button without refreshing page</s> -> Alert button refreshes page.</li>
<li><s>play button click -> game loop will start</s></li>
<li><s>play button will say "Click to restart" after game loop ended"</s> -> attempted and decided to use 'location.reload();' once alert is closed.</li>
<li>To move the player around, i'll make the person and enemy divs reappear and disappear every game interval. Plus they will be split into groups and somehow whilst incorporating math.random.

I recieved advice and I will try to use it well

- Add a bunch of console.log("gameTime is", gameTime); See what happens.

- Put a breakpoint in your code. Many browsers will let you do this. If not, use a debugger. Step through the code and look at the variable values.

- write down what each step of the code will do. Go line by line.
