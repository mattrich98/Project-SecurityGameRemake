# Project-SecurityGameRemake
<h2>Security Game Remake</h2>
<h4>"The Odin Project" javascript section is mostly read without application currently, so I need to put into practice what I have learned so far.</h4>
<hr>
<h3>Current Conclusion</h3>
<br>
<h4>I will continue with "The Odin Project" and put this project on hold for now as I need to gain more JavaScript knowledge to achieve what I want to do.
<br>
<br>
  It seems to me like I'm trying to do higher level things when I should focus on building up towards it. Therefore I will solely focus on the Odin Project until I'm ready.</h4>

Previously I've followed a tutorial for the other Security Game project <a href=https://github.com/mattrich98/Point-and-Click-Security-Game>Click here to see it</a>.

Furthermore I'd like to try the following:
<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Plans/Todos:</u></strong>
<ul>
<li>To complete this project with my current knowledge + some research. 
<li>To understand what I am doing. 
<br>
<br>
<li>To further practice JavaScript:
<br>
<ul>
<li>if/else</li> 
<li>loops</li>
<li>boolean</li> 
<li>string literals and etc.</li> 
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<hr>
<strong><u>JavaScript plans:</u></strong>
<ol>
<li><s>Game timer loop on ticks when play button starts</s></li>
<li><s>Add timer that links with timer loop</s></li>
<br>
<li><s>use math.random api to make enemy and person move random spaces on board</s></li>
<li><s>onclick enemy -1 point, onclick person +1 point</s></li>
<li><s>point system with alert at end saying score.</s></li>
<br>
<li><s>able to restart game from play button without refreshing page</s> -> Alert button refreshes page.</li>
<li><s>play button click -> game loop will start</s></li>
<li><s>play button will say "Click to restart" after game loop ended"</s> -> attempted and decided to use 'location.reload();' once alert is closed.</li>
<li>To move the player around, i'll make the person and enemy divs reappear and disappear every game interval. Plus they will be split into groups and somehow whilst incorporating math.random.
</ol>

I recieved advice and I will try to use it well

- Add a bunch of console.log("gameTime is", gameTime); See what happens.

- Put a breakpoint in your code. Many browsers will let you do this. If not, use a debugger. Step through the code and look at the variable values.

- write down what each step of the code will do. Go line by line.
