# Project-SecurityGameRemake
<h2>Security Game Remake</h2>
<h4>"The Odin Project" javascript section is mostly read without application currently, so I need to put into practice what I have learned so far.</h4>
<hr>
Previous I've followed a tutorial for the other Security Game project <a href=https://github.com/mattrich98/Point-and-Click-Security-Game>Click here to see it</a>. 
<br>
Furthermore I'd like to try the following:
<br>
<br>
<u>Plans/Todos:</u>
<ul>
<li>To complete this project with my current knowledge + some research. 
<li>To understand what I am doing. 
<br>
<br>
<li>To further practice JavaScript:
<br>
<ul>
<li>if/else</li> 
<li>loops</li>
<li>boolean</li> 
<li>string literals and etc.</li> 
</ul>
</ul>
